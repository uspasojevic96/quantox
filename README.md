## Notes
* In case that you need to replace the API key for coinmarketcap, it is located in `backend/src/routes.js` 
* In case that you need to change backend port it is located in `backend/src/index.js`
* In case that you change the backend port from above then you need to update the port in `src/app/services/api.service.ts`
* Clicking on Home returns you to list view
* Decided to keep bootstrap due to it's natural responsiveness
